# practice


This is my practice repository to learn git and github
no i have understand the concept how to make repository and what is done in initial commit
in README file Initialy what happen is that description and name of the repository got added as under initial commit
and .ignore contents is alsp added under this initial commit.

note:- if we add a file which is already tracked by git into .gitignore then we need to remove that file by using (git rm --cached README.md)
in general .gitignore will ignore those file only which is untracked
